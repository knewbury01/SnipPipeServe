    This gives some flexibility regarding what to do when a unacceptable certificate is sent. The JSSE chooses to send a fatal alert. (`setWantAuth` could in principle carry on with invalid certificates, but not treat the peer as authenticated, as if no client certificate was sent, but this isn't the case.)
    Previous versions of the TLS spec said "*If client authentication is required by the server for the handshake to continue, it may respond with a fatal handshake failure alert.*". This is the difference between need or want as implemented in the JSSE: using "need", the server responds with a fatal handshake failure, whereas using "want", the server carries on with the connection, but doesn't treat it as authenticated.
