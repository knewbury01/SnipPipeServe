       54    * This is a class that checks the revocation status of a certificate(s) using
       55    * OCSP. It is not a PKIXCertPathChecker and therefore can be used outside of
       56    * the CertPathValidator framework. It is useful when you want to
       57    * just check the revocation status of a certificate, and you don't want to
       58    * incur the overhead of validating all of the certificates in the
       59    * associated certificate chain.
